Interactive Streamlit Dashboard for Tweet Sentiment Analysis



## Documentation



So let me set the scene for you. Put yourself in the shoes of a market researcher based in the US who works in the aviation industry. She is trying to understand the pain points of customers who fly on various domestic U. S. Airlines such as Delta, United, Southwest Airlines, Virgin America and so on. Not only is she trying to understand the customer pain points herself, but she also has to report her insights and key results to stakeholders and decision makers in her company, such as the heads of the marketing department or, say the investment team at the Finance Department.

In reality, we are going to be using the Twitter US Airlines sentiment data set from Kaggle.

so now that our market researcher has the data in an easy to use format like a spreadsheet, we use programming language, Python, to perform the required data analysis and also uses some charting libraries, like Plotly, to create data visualizations. And that brings us to this dashboard.

Power Point presentations are extremely limiting and oftentimes boring. Now, rather than taking her word at face value, the key stakeholders and decision makers can quickly and very easily look at the relevant data themselves and select the types of visualizations that appeal most to them.
